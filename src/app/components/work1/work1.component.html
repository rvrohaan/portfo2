                    <p>This is a Python program designed to check whether a particular password has ever been breached or not. And if breached how many times was it breached.</p>

                        <p>Usually these kind of projects use what is called as Hasing to encrypt your password and check if it was breached or not. So ypu would have to provide the entire password to the website which you may or may not trust. Hence I built this project to check your password by sending only the first five characters of your password so as to keep it safe from the website as well.</p>
